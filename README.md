# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

This website for Horiseon Markatein was submitted for Refactor.

Corrected Accessibility and search engine optimizations, as follows:

1. Added content in meta field, to get some free advertisement on google search console.
2. Changed title content to Horiseon with its brief description for better identification on tabs.
3. Added Favicon for unique identification on tabs.
4. Added Alt attributes for content jpg images to meet WCAG standards.
5. Added empty Alt attributes for browsers to skip these sketch images.
6. Added a missing id attribute for searc-engine-optimization div in the content. Now clicking it in the header brings the page to this div in the content.
7. 
For this week's Challenge, your task is to refactor an existing webpage to make it accessible and to improve SEO. It's important to follow the Scout Rule when working with an existing codebase: Always leave the code a little cleaner than you found it. 

To impress the imaginary client for this Challenge, you should go the extra mile and improve their codebase for long-term sustainability. Ensure that all links are functioning correctly and clean up the CSS to make it more efficient, such as by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

Remember when working with a client, it is essential to read the acceptance criteria for guidance and clarity on what the client expects, especially when asked to make a judgment call, such as when an icon needs an accessible alt tag and when it is okay to leave it blank. 

To successfully complete this week's Challenge, all acceptance criteria must be fully addressed!
